Testing electron.js. 


I hope it will work without the node_modules folder. As far as I know, you need to type "npm install" in the terminal for them to be loaded.

This is just a test project that was created for learning Electron.js. I really enjoyed working with it and it's quite fun to develop applications in a language that I'm used to only building websites with.

The application is essentially a website but in .exe format. It's great if you're a talentless person who can only code in one language. Ha-ha-ha.

Anyway, I'll probably dive deeper into it, although after next.js (and for that, react.js, node.js, and databases, oh my...).
